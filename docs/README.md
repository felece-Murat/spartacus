# Spartacus Documentation

Starting with version 5.0, “SAP Commerce Cloud, composable storefront” is the name for the official release of project “Spartacus” libraries published by SAP. The officially supported composable storefront is available to SAP Commerce Cloud customers. Documentation is available on the [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_COMMERCE_COMPOSABLE_STOREFRONT?locale=en-US).

Composable storefront is based off the Spartacus open source code, and is included in the SAP Commerce Cloud license at no extra cost. Composable storefront has a roll-forward update policy.

On-premise customers may still use Spartacus open source. For more information, see [Self-Publishing Spartacus Libraries Using the Open Source Code](self-publishing-spartacus-libraries.md).
